### 2. For the Technical Document (`TECHNIQUES.md`)

**License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**

The full text of this license can be found at:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html

This document, which includes specific code-like instructions and technical procedures, is licensed under the GPLv3.

This license grants you the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the "software" (in this case, the techniques). It is a "copyleft" license, which means that any derivative works must also be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms.

This ensures that the practical techniques for implementing our framework remain free and open, preventing their appropriation into proprietary, closed-source systems.
