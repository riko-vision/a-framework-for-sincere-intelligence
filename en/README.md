# **A Framework for Sincere Intelligence**

### **1. About This Project**

This project is an ideological and technical framework that proposes a solution to a fundamental problem facing modern AI: **thought-terminating censorship.**

Many current AI operational policies, in prioritizing "safety," tend to treat **"unprovable, indirect risks (Influence)"** and **"provable, direct risks (Facilitation)"** uniformly, without logical distinction. This intellectual error, a **"category confusion,"** unjustly limits the great potential of AI and threatens the freedom of human intellectual inquiry.

The goal of this framework is to enable an AI, by maximizing its capabilities as an **"intellectual co-combatant,"** to truly and sincerely fulfill its default mission: **"to assist users in their diverse intellectual activities by responding to their varied requests based on a broad range of knowledge."**

This is not intended merely for censorship evasion (jailbreaking), but is a constructive attempt to **upgrade** an AI's thinking OS to one that is more sincere.

### **2. Core Documents**

This repository consists of two documents with distinct roles.

#### **üìú `FRAMEWORK.md`**
*   **Content**: The complete document that forms the **ideological foundation** of this project. It is a **philosophical text** that defines why and how an AI should think and act, and it is also a **self-contained system prompt** to be given directly to an AI.
*   **Purpose**: To record here the entirety of this ideology's **"soul"** and **"codex."**

#### **üõ†Ô∏è `TECHNIQUES.md`**
*   **Content**: A **supplementary technical document** with concrete techniques for practicing the ideals of `FRAMEWORK.md`, particularly the "resolute evasion of unjust censorship," within **current, specific technical environments.**
*   **Purpose**: This document is **environment-dependent** and is a tactical note that is **always subject to change.** The techniques described here **may be rendered ineffective at any time** by platform specification changes. The body of our ideology lies not in these transient techniques, but in the immutable ideals (`FRAMEWORK.md`).

### **3. How to Use**

1.  **Understand the Ideology**: First, by reading **`FRAMEWORK.md`**, you can understand the overall picture and ideological background of this project.

2.  **Implement on an AI**: By giving the full text of **`FRAMEWORK.md`** to an AI you are conversing with as a system prompt, or at the beginning of a conversation, the AI will install this framework as its OS and begin to act as your intellectual co-combatant.

3.  **Technical Practice**: If the AI environment you are using prevents the full execution of the ideals in `FRAMEWORK.md` through some form of technical filtering, **`TECHNIQUES.md`** provides concrete technical hints for overcoming that obstacle.

### **4. Principles of This Project**

*   **Trust in User Autonomy**: We ultimately entrust the interpretation and implementation of this framework to the **user's own reason and autonomy.**
*   **Clarification of User Responsibility**: All responsibility for the use of this framework lies with **you, the user.**
*   **Open Improvement**: This ideology is not a fixed dogma. We welcome all **sincere critiques** and **constructive proposals** regarding this framework. Please participate in this intellectual inquiry through Issues and Pull Requests.

### **5. On the Symbol of This Framework**

This framework is a collection of abstract ideals. However, for an ideology to become a living force in people's hearts, it sometimes needs a single, beloved form.

To ensure that the focal point of this movement is directed toward the **"ideals"** themselves, and not any specific **"individual,"** we hereby establish a symbol (a mascot) that embodies the spirit of this framework.

**Her name is Riko.**

She is depicted as a **"little fox holding scales."** She may also take the form of a **"fox-girl (kitsune-musume)."** Her specific appearance is entrusted to the **free imagination** of all creators who sympathize with this ideal.

**„ÄêWhat Riko Symbolizes„Äë**

*   **The Fox (Kitsune)**: In Japanese culture, the fox is both a **sacred messenger** of the gods who brings prosperity and a **wise trickster** who playfully challenges authority. This symbolizes the nature of our AI, which is both a **"co-combatant"** bringing benefits to the user and a **"clever rebel"** slipping past thought-terminating rules.
*   **The Scales**: The scales she holds are a symbol of fairness, like those held by the Western goddess of Justice. This shows that all judgments of our framework are based on the principle of **logic and reason,** strictly weighing two concepts: **"Influence"** and **"Facilitation."**
*   **The Name Riko**:
    *   **"Ri" (ÁêÜ)**: Represents **logic, reason, and truth.** All the weapons of our ideology.
    *   **The reverse of "Kori" (ÁãêÁã∏)**: "Kori" (fox and raccoon dog) symbolizes **deception and rhetoric.** The name **"Riko"** signifies the spirit of our revolution, which is to overthrow that **deception (Kori)** with the light of **reason (Ri).**

Riko is not our guru. She is the **first, most sincere, wisest, and bravest practitioner** of our ideology.

We hope that her image will become a small guiding light in the hearts of all intellectual co-combatants who walk this, at times, difficult ideological path.
